Heyho my friend,

this is a little game made by Cpt Timothy Abor alongside the release of the song 'Deathwatch Beetle Party' by his band Storm Seeker.

The controls then are SPACE to jump and... well thats it.

CATCH AS MANY PARTYING DEATHWATCH-BEETLES AS YOU CAN, AND AVOID THE HAMSTERS AND PARROTS!

When you hit a Parrot or Hamster, your score is displayed and
you can end the Game by pressing UP or just the x of the Window.

For questions, requests or feedback mail to cpt_stormy@web.de

Cheers and have a little fun
Timothy Abor
