Heyho my friend,

this is a little game made by Cpt Timothy Abor alongside the release of the song 'Deathwatch Beetle Party' by his band Storm Seeker.

For Windows-users its rather simple to start, just double-click.
The controls then are SPACE to jump and... well thats it.

CATCH AS MANY PARTYING DEATHWATCH-BEETLES AS YOU CAN, AND AVOID THE HAMSTERS AND PARROTS!

When you hit a Parrot or Hamster, your score is displayed and
you can end the Game by pressing UP or just the x of the Window.

For questions, requests or feedback mail to cpt_stormy@web.de

Cheers and have a little fun
Timothy Abor
